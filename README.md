# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Web App

A sleek, weather forecast application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, powered by the **WeatherAPI**. This project showcases real-time weather data for any city entered by the user, with a clean UI and dynamic content updates.

🔐 Important: In script.js, replace with your actual WeatherAPI key in the following line:
const apiKey = "  ";

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a city name in the input field.
2. `script.js` sends a request to WeatherAPI.
3. The response is parsed and displayed dynamically:
   - Temperature
   - Weather condition
   - Location details
4. Errors (like invalid city names) are handled gracefully.
5. A toggle button allows switching between light and dark themes by dynamically updating CSS classes.
